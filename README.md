# Nuka-Cola Project

Welcome to the Nuka-Cola project! Nuka-Cola is a re-designed Coca-Cola clone inspired by the Fallout series of games. It is a personal project created solely for educational and portfolio purposes.

I have implemented several commonly used features such as timer, slider, modal etc. to test my proficiency in writing pure JavaScript code without the use of frameworks.

## Technologies Used

- **Vanilla JavaScript**

- **Vite**

- **Tailwind CSS**

- **HTML**
